```bash
npm i eslint-pre-commit-hook -D
```

or:

```bash
yarn add eslint-pre-commit-hook -D
```

## Usage

**There is no further requirements after installation.** It automatically sets `pre-commit` hook after installation.
Check `.git/hooks/pre-commit` to sure. Also, make sure it's executable.

You can customize its default behaviour by setting `breakOnWarningsToo`
field in your `package.json` file:

```json
  "eslintPreCommit": {
    "breakOnWarningsToo": true
  }
```

Then it'll be failed on both errors and warnings (no errors or warnings allowed).
